# Module4 / Project1 / CSS Animation

## Project Brief

Create a single page site with animated elements created in CSS.

## The Goal

<li>Understand the mechanisms CSS offers to animate</li>
<li>Be able to create animations with CSS</li>

## Intro

I created a landing page for a site that I created in Module 3, project 2 (HTML & CSS - Tooling/Sass). I really liked the page it self and I though it was interesting and I had alreadu created a logo that I knew I could do some cool animation with.

## The Process

I started messing with the logo in <strong>Figma<strong> and once I was happy with the animation I started creating a layout that I found appealing, made sure that everything scaled the way I want it to. Once everything was set i put the project together in <strong>VS Code</strong>.

## The Journey

Animation is one tough cookie and I had a really hard time wrapping my brain around it because it is not done the way I am used to do animation. But my main interest in coding lies there so I dove into it and man I love it. So the process was tough but I am so happy that I finally got hang of it and this is something that I would love to master.

## The Conclusion

Animation is a great way to give your site that extra oumph that it might be lacking. I would love to master the animation part of coding because I believe that animation will be a big part of web design in the future. One of my favorite project so far.
